# Write Or Scream

Welcome to the "Write Or Scream" project! This is a simple HTML project that is inspired by the legendary Write Or Die, providing a writing environment with a twist. Users have a word target to reach within a specified time limit. Failure to meet the target results in a surprising twist, making the experience both challenging and entertaining.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aitrium/writeorscream
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Features

- **Word Count Tracking:** The application tracks the number of words you've written in real-time.
- **Word Target Setting:** You can set a specific word target that you aim to reach before the time limit expires.
- **Time Limit:** The application includes a timer that counts down from the specified time limit.
- **Interactive Timer Display:** The timer dynamically updates and changes color when the user is inactive for too long.
- **Surprise Twist:** If you fail to meet your word target within the time limit, a scream sound effect is triggered, making the experience more engaging.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Start writing in the provided text area.
3. Set your word target and time limit using the input fields.
4. Click the "Start" button to begin the challenge.
